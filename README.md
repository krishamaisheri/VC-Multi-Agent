## Voice Processing Pipeline

The system implements a complete voice processing pipeline:

1. **Frontend Audio Capture**: Web Audio API captures microphone input
2. **Base64 Encoding**: Audio data encoded for transmission
3. **Backend Processing**: Flask receives and decodes audio
4. **Speech-to-Text**: SpeechRecognition transcribes audio to text
5. **AI Processing**: Mistral AI processes the transcribed text
6. **Text-to-Speech**: gTTS converts response to audio
7. **Base64 Response**: Audio response encoded and sent to frontend
8. **Frontend Playback**: Browser plays the audio response

## RAG System Integration

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system enhances responses by:

1. **Document Ingestion**: Startup pitch data stored in Qdrant
2. **Vector Embeddings**: Sentence transformers create embeddings
3. **Similarity Search**: Relevant context retrieved based on queries
4. **Context Enhancement**: Retrieved information augments AI responses
5. **Conversational Memory**: System maintains conversation context

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Backend not starting:**
- Check Python dependencies are installed
- Verify Qdrant database is running
- Ensure environment variables are set correctly

**Voice features not working:**
- Check microphone permissions in browser
- Verify internet connection for speech services
- Ensure audio format compatibility

**Frontend not connecting to backend:**
- Verify backend is running on port 5000
- Check CORS settings in Flask application
- Ensure no firewall blocking connections

**Qdrant connection issues:**
- Verify Qdrant service is running
- Check connection parameters
- Ensure proper network configuration

### Performance Optimization

- Use local Qdrant instance for better performance
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Optimize embedding generation for large datasets
- Consider using local speech models for offline operation

## Security Considerations

- API keys should be stored securely in environment variables
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with local Whisper model for offline speech recognition
- Support for video pitch analysis
- Advanced analytics and reporting features
- Multi-language support
- Integration with external data sources
- Real-time collaboration features
- Mobile application development
